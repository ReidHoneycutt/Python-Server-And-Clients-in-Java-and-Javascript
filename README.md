# This is a example of a server in python and several clients

# server.py 
- creates a server
- sends a packet to a client that connects to it

# client.js
To write a JavaScript client that connects to this server and receives the packet sent by the /send(client_socket) function, you need to use Node.js with the net module, as browser-based JavaScript does not support direct TCP socket connections due to security reasons.
