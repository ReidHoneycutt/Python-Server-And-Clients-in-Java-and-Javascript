# python_server.py 
- spins up a server
- sends a packet of the integer 10 in byte code 
- To write a JavaScript client that connects to this server and receives the packet sent by the send(client_socket) function, you need to use Node.js with the net module, as browser-based JavaScript does not support direct TCP socket connections due to security reasons.
